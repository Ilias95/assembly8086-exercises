My own solutions to the lab exercises of the course "Computer Organization and Architecture" of teithe.

Code is written in assembly for the Intel 8086 processor and tested with emu8086.

Course page: http://aetos.it.teithe.gr/~dima/assembly_main.html

All code is in the public domain and distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
